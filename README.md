> A list that can be used in App Store descriptions

Welcome to the iOS AppStore Symbol Gallery! This repository provides a curated collection of symbols that you can use in the descriptions of your iOS apps on the App Store.

Apple has prohibited the use of some ASCII symbols in its descriptions. We've discovered a few that work.

## How to Use

Using symbols from this repository is straightforward:

1. **Browse Symbols**: Take a look at the list below to find the symbol you want to use.

2. **Copy and Paste**: Simply copy the symbol you want and paste it into your app's description on the App Store.
